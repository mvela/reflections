When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Users would want to do this if they wish to collaborate with others on their 
work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It makes sense to pull changes manually because changes in the working directory
would be overwritten.
