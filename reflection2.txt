What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it sets up the directory to be able to
be controlled with git.  This is useful for being able to control different
versions of the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the area in which files are added that will need
to be commited.  The value in this is that it presents an area for the 
user to observe what files they have added that will be commited, ensuring
other files that they do not wish to be commited are not commited.
