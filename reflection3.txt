When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

Users would want to do this if they wish to collaborate with others on their 
work.

-----

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It makes sense to pull changes manually because changes in the working directory
would be overwritten.

-----

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks: Use to copy a repository on GitHub in order to modify it for your own
purposes.

Clones: Use to make a copy of a repository to a local directory.

Branch: Use to add an experimental commit branch for things such as new features
leaving the master branch intact.

-----

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

The benefit of this is that you have a saved point in which your repository
matched the other repository at a given time.  With this, it can be observable
what changes have been made since it was last copied on both GitHub and the
local repository.
